# Pacman CSS Challenge

## Description
A recreation of the classic Pacman gameboard with CSS and a tiny bit of Tailwind.  I did this as an excercise to level up my CSS.  I ran into all sorts of unforseen challenges but one that stands out is recreating the games font.  Before starting I assumed I would be able to find a simple import but I was wrong.  So my solution was to recreate it with code using CSS Grid.
